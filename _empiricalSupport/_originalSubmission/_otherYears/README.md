Version 2. Difference from version 1: folder `y-2023` added.

This folder contains seeds generated from our current `6x4` pattern on additional years, besides year 2021, which we have attacked previously.

Each subfolder in this folder corresponds to one year, specified in the name of the folder: `y-2007`, `y-2008` etc.
Each subfolder contains:

* the thematic dictionary of that year. E.g., `y-2007/them-dic-07.txt` etc.
* a subfolder `pzl` (e.g., `y-2007/pzl`), which contains zero or more seeds. They are all seeds generated for the year at hand.
* other files, irrelevant for the purpose of the task described below.

Seeds and the corresponding thematic dictionaries should be used to evolve the seeds into full solutions, in the manner already performed for year 2021.

Here is the number of seeds generated for each year:

 - `y-2007` `94`
 - `y-2008` `0`
 - `y-2011` `5275`
 - `y-2013` `941`
 - `y-2014` `208`
 - `y-2016` `80`
 - `y-2017` `0`
 - `y-2018` `4`
 - `y-2019` `0`
 - `y-2023` `544`

The top 12 human results contain grids that include our `6x4` pattern in only two years: 2013 and 2021. Interestingly, we have obtained seeds in additional years, as seen in the stats above. Perhaps some of these will lead to top-level solutions different from the top human ones.

\ie compute the score

\bei
\ie filling a configuration of $26$ black cells with words takes minutes
\ie thus, only a small number of such combinations can be filled in

\begin{frame}{What is Next?}

\bei

\ie seeds themselves have very low scores due to empty spaces

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Selecting Promising Seeds to Complete}

\bei

\ie trying to complete each seed is too expensive

\bigskip
\bigskip

\ie select promising seeds via Monte Carlo
\bei
\ie for each seed place additional black cells in the empty area
\ie quickly run {\sc Wombat} on it 
\ie repeat until per-seed time budget is exhausted
\ie the maximum score of each rollout is the seed's MC score
\eei

\bigskip
\bigskip

\ie could use such MC seed completions as the final solution
\bei
\ie MC rollouts do not allow incremental improvements
\ie insufficiently high scores
\eei

\eei


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Evolving Promising Seeds Into Full Solutions}

\bei

\ie sort all seeds by their MC scores

\bigskip
\bigskip

\ie complete the top $N$ seeds via incremental improvements
\bei
\ie can use various search techniques
\ie the space is large so stochastic searches are promising
\ie standard genetic algorithms risk a population collapse
\ie we use a version of MAP-Elites~[\cite{mapElites}]
\bei
\ie maintains diversity explicitly
\ie via the use of maps

\begin{frame}{MAP-Elites}

\bei

\ie MAP-Elites stores its population in a map
\bei
\ie a map is a 2D table
\ie each row and column correspond to feature values
\bei
\ie maximum word slot length ($f_1$)
\ie number of walls ($f_2$)
\eei
\ie elites from different cells do not compete
\eei
\ie on each generation a few elites are randomly picked from each map
\ie each elite is mutated (seed area protected)
\ie each offspring is run through {\sc Wombat} (higher time limit)
\ie a scored offspring replaces an existing elite if its score is higher

\begin{frame}{Multi-map MAP-Elites}

\bei

\ie how large should the maps/tables be?
\bei
\ie too many cells $\to$ little competition

\ie every one is a champion in its own niche
\eei

\ie too few cells $\to$ too much competition
\bei
\ie danger of collapsing to a single individual

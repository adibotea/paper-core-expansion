\begin{frame}{Our Approach: Intuition}

\bei

\ie \tcb{naive approach} 
\bei 
\ie try different combinations of $26$ black cells on a $13 \times 13$ grid
\ie fill in each with words via {\sc Wombat}
\ie compute the score
\ie select the best
\eei

\bigskip

\ie \tcm{problems}
\bei
\ie filling a configuration of $26$ black cells with words takes minutes
\ie thus, only a small number of such combinations can be filled in
\ie needle in a hay stack...
\eei

\bigskip

\ie \tcg{proposed solution}
\bei
\ie start with a cluster of thematic words $\to$ guaranteed score points
\ie build the rest of the grid around it

	abstract = {There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics (the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on many parameters). A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.},

	abstract = {This article describes a new Metropolis-like transition rule, the multiple-try Metropolis, for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. By using this transition rule together with adaptive direction sampling, we propose a novel method for incorporating local optimization steps into a MCMC sampler in continuous state-space. Numerical studies show that the new method performs significantly better than the traditional Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) sampler. With minor tailoring in using the rule, the multiple-try method can also be exploited to achieve the effect of a griddy Gibbs sampler without having to bear with griddy approximations, and the effect of a hit-and-run algorithm without having to figure out the required conditional distribution in a random direction.},

	Abstract = {Workers of the Argentine ant, Iridomyrmex humilis,start to explore a chemically unmarked territory randomly. As the exploratory front advances, other explorers are recruited and a trail extends from it to the nest. Whereas recruitment trails are generally constructed between two points, these exploratory trails have no fixed destination, and strongly resemble the foraging patterns of army ants. A minimal model shows how the exploratory pattern may be generated by the individual workers' simple trail-laying and -following behavior, illustrating how complex collective structures in insect colonies may be based on self-organization.},

@article{gomez_incremental_1997,
	Abstract = {Several researchers have demonstrated how complex action sequences can be learned through neuroevolution (i.e., evolving neural networks with genetic algorithms). However, complex general behavior such as evading predators or avoiding obstacles, which is not tied to specific environments, turns out to be very difficult to evolve. Often the system discovers mechanical strategies, such as moving back and forth, that help the agent cope but are not very effective, do not appear believable, and do not generalize to new environments. The problem is that a general strategy is too difficult for the evolution system to discover directly. This article proposes an approach wherein such complex general behavior is learned incrementally, by starting with simpler behavior and gradually making the task more challenging and general. The task transitions are implemented through successive stages of Delta coding (i.e., evolving modifications), which allows even converged populations to adapt to the new task. The method is tested in the stochastic, dynamic task of prey capture and is compared with direct evolution. The incremental approach evolves more effective and more general behavior and should also scale up to harder tasks.},

@article{Cowley2016,
	Abstract = {As player demographics broaden it has become important to understand variation in player types. Improved player models can help game designers create games that accommodate a range of playing styles, and may also facilitate the design of systems that detect the currently-expressed player type and adapt dynamically in real-time. Existing approaches can model players, but most focus on tracking and classifying behaviour based on simple functional metrics such as deaths, specific choices, player avatar attributes, and completion times. We describe a novel approach which seeks to leverage expert domain knowledge using a theoretical framework linking behaviour and game design patterns. The aim is to derive features of play from sequences of actions which are intrinsically informative about behaviour---which, because they are directly interpretable with respect to psychological theory of behaviour, we name `Behavlets'. We present the theoretical underpinning of this approach from research areas including psychology, temperament theory, player modelling, and game composition. The Behavlet creation process is described in detail; illustrated using a clone of the well-known game Pac-Man, with data gathered from 100 participants. A workshop-based evaluation study is also presented, where nine game design expert participants were briefed on the Behavlet concepts and requisite models, and then attempted to apply the method to games of the well-known first/third-person shooter genres, exemplified by `Gears of War', (Microsoft). The participants found 139 Behavlet concepts mapping from behavioural preferences of the temperament types, to design patterns of the shooter genre games. We conclude that the Behavlet approach has significant promise, is complementary to existing methods and can improve theoretical validity of player models.},

@techreport{machine-teaching-new-paradigm-building-machine-learning-systems,
	Abstract = {The current processes for building machine learning systems require practitioners with deep knowledge of machine learning. This significantly limits the number of machine learning systems that can be created and has led to a mismatch between the demand for machine learning systems and the ability for organizations to build them. We believe that in order to meet this growing demand for machine learning systems we must significantly increase the number of individuals that can teach machines. We postulate that we can achieve this goal by making the process of teaching machines easy, fast and above all, universally accessible.
	
	While machine learning focuses on creating new algorithms and improving the accuracy of "learners", the machine teaching discipline focuses on the efficacy of the "teachers". Machine teaching as a discipline is a paradigm shift that follows and extends principles of software engineering and programming languages. We put a strong emphasis on the teacher and the teacher's interaction with data, as well as crucial components such as techniques and design principles of interaction and visualization. 
	
	In this paper, we present our position regarding the discipline of machine teaching and articulate fundamental machine teaching principles. We also describe how, by decoupling knowledge about machine learning algorithms from the process of teaching, we can accelerate innovation and empower millions of new uses for machine learning models.},

@article{Schmidhuber2010a,
	Abstract = {The simple, but general formal theory of fun and intrinsic motivation and creativity (1990-2010) is based on the concept of maximizing intrinsic reward for the active creation or discovery of novel, surprising patterns allowing for improved prediction or data compression. It generalizes the traditional field of active learning, and is related to old, but less formal ideas in aesthetics theory and developmental psychology. It has been argued that the theory explains many essential aspects of intelligence including autonomous development, science, art, music, and humor. This overview first describes theoretically optimal (but not necessarily practical) ways of implementing the basic computational principles on exploratory, intrinsically motivated agents or robots, encouraging them to provoke event sequences exhibiting previously unknown, but learnable algorithmic regularities. Emphasis is put on the importance of limited computational resources for online prediction and compression. Discrete and continuous time formulations are given. Previous practical, but nonoptimal implementations (1991, 1995, and 1997-2002) are reviewed, as well as several recent variants by others (2005-2010). A simplified typology addresses current confusion concerning the precise nature of intrinsic motivation.},

	Abstract = {In model-based reinforcement learning it is typical to decouple the problems of learning the dynamics model and learning the reward function. However, when the dynamics model is flawed, it may generate erroneous states that would never occur in the true environment. It is not clear a priori what value the reward function should assign to such states. This paper presents a novel error bound that accounts for the reward model's behavior in states sampled from the model. This bound is used to extend the existing Hallucinated DAgger-MC algorithm, which offers theoretical performance guarantees in deterministic MDPs that do not assume a perfect model can be learned. Empirically, this approach to reward learning can yield dramatic improvements in control performance when the dynamics model is flawed.},

@article{bulitko08-dlrta-jair,
	Abstract = {Real-time heuristic search is a challenging type of agent-centered search because the agent's planning time per action is bounded by a constant independent of problem size. A common problem that imposes such restrictions is pathfinding in modern computer games where a large number of units must plan their paths simultaneously over large maps. Common search algorithms (e.g., A*, IDA*, D*, ARA*, AD*) are inherently not real-time and may lose completeness when a constant bound is imposed on per-action planning time. Real-time search algorithms retain completeness but frequently produce unacceptably suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we extend classic and modern real-time search algorithms with an automated mechanism for dynamic depth and subgoal selection. The new algorithms remain real-time and complete. On large computer game maps, they find paths within 7\% of optimal while on average expanding roughly a single state per action. This is nearly a three-fold improvement in suboptimality over the existing state-of-the-art algorithms and, at the same time, a 15-fold improvement in the amount of planning per action.},

	Abstract = {Considers the case of heuristic search where the location of the goal
	may change during the course of the search. We present a moving target
	search algorithm (MTS) to solve this problem. We prove that the
	algorithm is complete i.e. if the average speed of the target is
	slower than that of the problem solver, then the problem solver is
	guaranteed to eventually reach the target. The algorithm proposed is
	neither efficient nor intelligent. Innovative notions are introduced
	into the formal search algorithm to improve the efficiency. The
	notions created are: (i) commitment to goals, and (ii) deliberation
	for selecting plans. We show how these notions effectively overcome
	the bottleneck of MTS performance. The improved algorithm behaves like
	a predator. In clear situations, the problem solver is always
	sensitive to the target's moves and reactively moves towards the
	targets current position; while in uncertain situations, the problem
	solver ignores the target's moves, commits to its current goal, and
	attempts to find a promising direction to reach the goal.},

	Abstract = {The author previously proposed the moving target search (MTS)
	algorithm, where the location of the goal may change during the course
	of the search. MTS is the first search algorithm concerned with
	problem solving in a dynamically changing environment. However, since
	he constructed the algorithm with the minimum operations necessary for
	guaranteeing its completeness, the algorithm as proposed is neither
	efficient nor intelligent. He introduces innovative notions created in
	the area of resource-bounded planning into the formal search
	algorithm, MTS. His goal is to improve the efficiency of MTS, while
	retaining its completeness. Notions that are introduced are (1)
	commitment to goals, and (2) deliberation for selecting
	plans. Evaluation results demonstrate that the intelligent MTS is 10
	to 20 times more efficient than the original MTS in uncertain
	situations.},

@techreport{koen:92b,
	Abstract = {This report analyzes the complexity of on-line reinforcement learning
	algorithms, namely asynchronous real-time versions of Q-learning and
	value-iteration, applied to the problems of reaching any goal state
	from the given start state and finding shortest paths from all states
	to a goal state. Previous work had concluded that, in many cases,
	initially uninformed (i.e. tabula rasa) reinforcement learning was
	exponential for such problems, or that it was tractable (i.e. of
	polynomial time-complexity) only if the learning algorithm was
	augmented. We prove that, to the contrary, the algorithms are
	tractable with only a simple change in the task representation
	('penalizing the agent for action executions') or initialization
	('initializing high'). We provide tight bounds on their worst-case
	complexity, and show how the complexity is even smaller if the state
	space has certain special properties. We compare these reinforcement
	learning algorithms to other uninformed on-line search methods and to
	informed off-line search methods, and investigate how initial
	knowledge of the topology of the state space can decrease their
	complexity. We also present two novel algorithms, the bi-directional
	Q-learning algorithm and the bi-directional value-iteration algorithm,
	for finding shortest paths from all states to a goal state, and show
	that they are no more complex than their counterparts for reaching a
	goal state from a given start state. The worst-case analysis of the
	reinforcement learning algorithms is complemented by an empirical
	study of their average-case complexity in three domains.},

	abstract = {With the maturing of technology for model checking and constraint solving, there is an emerging opportunity to develop programming tools that can transform the way systems are specified. In this paper, we propose a new way to program distributed protocols using concolic snippets. Concolic snippets are sample execution fragments that contain both concrete and symbolic values. The proposed approach allows the programmer to describe the desired system partially using the traditional model of communicating extended finite-state-machines (EFSM), along with high-level invariants and concrete execution fragments. Our synthesis engine completes an EFSM skeleton by inferring guards and updates from the given fragments which is then automatically analyzed using a model checker with respect to the desired invariants. The counterexamples produced by the model checker can then be used by the programmer to add new concrete execution fragments that describe the correct behavior in the specific scenario corresponding to the counterexample.We describe TRANSIT, a language and prototype implementation of the proposed specification methodology for distributed protocols. Experimental evaluations of TRANSIT to specify cache coherence protocols show that (1) the algorithm for expression inference from concolic snippets can synthesize expressions of size 15 involving typical operators over commonly occurring types, (2) for a classical directory-based protocol, TRANSIT automatically generates, in a few seconds, a complete implementation from a specification consisting of the EFSM structure and a few concrete examples for every transition, and (3) a published partial description of the SGI Origin cache coherence protocol maps directly to symbolic examples and leads to a complete implementation in a few iterations, with the programmer correcting counterexamples resulting from underspecified transitions by adding concrete examples in each iteration.},

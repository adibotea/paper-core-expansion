\section{Conclusion}

Many types of constraint optimization problems remain challenging to current
technology.
In this work we focused on
the Romanian Crosswords Competition Problem,
a challenging domain where AI performance has been lagging significantly behind top human performance.
We presented an approach that first builds a core with a high contribution to the score function,
and then builds the rest of the solution around it.
Using as input the size of a rectangular core and the placement of two black cells inside the core,
we build full solutions that are competitive to top human performance,
boosting previous AI results.
We believe that our results might give a basis to exceeding top human performance with fully automated solutions in future work.

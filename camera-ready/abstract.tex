In constraint optimization
many problem instances
remain challenging to current technology.
We focus on the Romanian Crosswords Competition Problem.
It is a challenging, NP-hard constraint optimization problem
where state-of-the-art AI has been lagging significantly behind top human performance.
We present an approach that first builds a core, a portion of the problem that will 
have a high contribution to the objective function.
A core is grown into a seed, a partial solution with
a subset of variables defined and instantiated.
Seeds are further extended into full solutions.
Our approach takes as input the size of a rectangular core to consider,
and the locations of zero or more black cells inside the core.
The results advance state-of-the-art substantially.
We report a boost in the scores obtained, bringing our top solutions
in the vicinity of top human entries.

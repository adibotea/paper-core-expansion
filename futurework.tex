\section{Future Work}

Future work will attempt to synthesize grids with higher scores via increasing the amount of computation as well as handling illegal evolved grids in a more sophisticated fashion. For the former, given more computational resources one can increase the number of seeds ranked and evolved, increase the time limit for estimating each seed's score during ranking, increase the time limit in {\sc Wombat} to get higher scores for a candidate grid, maintain more maps and increase the evolution time limit. 

For the latter we currently allow illegal grids to be placed on a map. This helps the evolution by storing intermediate steps or missing links towards a legal high-score grid. However, because each such illegal grid automatically gets a score of $-1$ there is no measure of quality for the missing links. Thus one illegal grid can never replace another one on a map and no latent mutations are accumulated over time. Future work will remedy this by introducing a dedicated measure of quality for illegal grids. One possibility is to consider the offspring score potential~\cite{FI2Pop,FI2Pop2}.

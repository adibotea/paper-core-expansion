A simplified version of The Romanian Crosswords Competition problem was posed
in the 2018 XCSP Competition~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1901-01830}.
Thirteen instances are featured in the competition, 
with square grids whose sizes range $3 \times 3$ to $15 \times 15$.
Eight instances remained unsolved \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1901-01830}.
\citeauthor{DBLP:conf/ecai/AudemardLM20}~\shortcite{DBLP:conf/ecai/AudemardLM20}
use the same representation
as a testbed for using segmented tables
to encode constraints.

\citeauthor{DBLP:conf/socs/BoteaB21}~\shortcite{DBLP:conf/socs/BoteaB21,Botea_Bulitko_2022}
focus on a subproblem inspired from the {\sc RoCo}.
Specifically, they assume that 
a good configuration of black cells 
(i.e., a configuration that will allow a high score)
is given apriori as part of the input.
When a good configuration of black cells,
such as a configuration extracted from top human entries,
is given as input, AI can successfully generate high-quality scores,
such as reproducing top human scores \cite{DBLP:conf/socs/BoteaB21}.

However, giving the black cell configuration as input is a massive help to an AI system.
Automatically finding a good configuration of black cells
has been challenging. 
\citeauthor{DBLP:conf/cig/BulitkoB21}~\shortcite{DBLP:conf/cig/BulitkoB21}
present a method to automatically search for black cell configurations.
In their work, scores obtained based on automatically generated
black cell configurations have been significantly lower than 
top human scores.
As mentioned in the introduction, our work boosts scores
to bring them within the vicinity of top human performance.


The literature has seen work on additional types crosswords problems,
such as solving crosswords puzzles.
A problem instance is defined by a grid with black cells but no letters,
and a list of clues.
The task is then to fill the grid with words that match the 
clues~\cite{DBLP:journals/ai/LittmanKS02,DBLP:conf/aaai/ErnandesAG05,DBLP:journals/jair/Ginsberg11,Chen-icaps22}.
This is a significantly problem compared to {\sc RoCo}.


\begin{comment}
The problem of \emph{crosswords grid generation} takes as input
a list of words and
a grid with only black cells.
The task is to fill the grid with words from the
list~\cite{MAZLACK19761,10.5555/1865499.1865531,botea-modref07,anbulagan-botea-cp08}.
As mentioned in the introduction and in Section~\ref{sec::background}, {\sc Roco}
is a significant generalization of the standard crosswords grid generation.
